= Asciidoctor Blogspot

This repo contains a template and an extension that I use to convert AsciiDoc documents to an HTML format that I paste directly to blogspot new post.
So in this way I can write new articles in AsciiDoc format and then publish them in Blogspot.

* Each of subsection title is wrapped around `<b>` tags.
* There is an special block called `gist` that takes the content of the block, uploads to gist, and embed the result using `<script>` tag.

You can see an example at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lordofthejars/asciidoctor-blogspot/master/gist-block/sample.adoc

To run it:

`asciidoctor -r <repo>/gist-block.rb -T <repo>/slim <document>`
